Just a brief biography about me: i was born on october 14 1998 and then I moved to the United States just before I started first grade. In terms of my education life I spent my preschool and kindergarten years in a school in Lam tin, Hong Kong. After I moved to the United States I went to Ps79 elementary school. After I finished elementary school I went to JHS 185 for 6th grade and then to MS 74 for 7th and 8th grade to wrap up my middle school career, then I went to Cardozo High School to complete my high school career.
